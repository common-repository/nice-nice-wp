Adds a shortcode and a widget to easily embed pictures of Vanilla Ice into your WordPress website. Choose any size placeholder you like!

== Description ==

NiceNice WP makes adding Vanilla Ice to your website easier than ever before! Now you can embed the Ice Man placeholder images using a shortcode or a widget. This will help you make sure your website's layout isn't Tom Cruisin' for a bruisin'.

This plugin is based entirely on http://nicenicejpg.com.

= How to Use The Shortcode =

Using NiceNice WP is pretty simple. Once it's installed, you can choose to embed a picture using the NiceNice WP widget or the [nicenice] shortcode.

To use the shortcode, simply add the shortcode to a post, page or custom post type. Here are all the possible options:

`[nicenice]` Embeds a super awesome picture of Vanilla Ice with the default width of 500px.

`[nicenice width="400" height="200"]` Embeds a 400x200 picture of Mr. Van Winkle. The width and height can be changed to anything you like.

`[nicenice width="350"] or [nicenice height="350"]` Embeds a 350x350 square image of the hero you got with after you dropped the zero.

For an extra bonus, set fiveo="true".

`[nicenice width="400" height="200" fiveo="true"]` Embeds a 400x200 picture of the most boss mustang you've ever seen.

You can also select how to align the images by setting align="left", align="right", or align="center".

`[nicenice width="400" height="200" align="center"]` Embeds a 400x200 picture of Vanilla Ice, centered in the page.

= How to Use The Widget =

I don't know all the certain words to word it, but using the widget is mad easy. Drop that bad boy into place and then check out the hook while my DJ revolves it.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `nicenice` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate **NiceNice WP** through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In the Post editor, type `[nicenice]` to embed a picture of Vanilla Ice.
4. If you need to display Vanilla Ice in a sidebar area, drop the NiceNice WP widget into place and choose your image size.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will This Work With My Theme? =

Yes! This plugin will work with all WordPress themes. The only thing you might have an issue with is the alignment. In order to keep things light, we're not including any styles. If your theme doesn't support the default WordPress image alignment properties, the alignment won't work.

= Something is Broken. Can you Help? =

I got caught up on drugs for a few years, I'm off it, I'm very happy, got two kids and a family and everything. And like I said I'm making the underground music, and keeping it real.

If you want to keep it real too, submit your bugs to https://github.com/fatmedia/nicenice-wp/

= Where can I submit an Idea for Making NiceNice WP Even More Awesome? =

It wasn't until '94 when I tried to commit suicide that I realized that it wasn't about the money.
